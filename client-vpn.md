Okay, here's a summary of the key points we've covered regarding AWS Client VPN:

* **DNS Resolution:** To access resources within your VPC (like EC2 instances) by DNS name from your laptop connected via Client VPN, you *must* configure the Client VPN endpoint to push your VPC's DNS server IP address (usually the VPC CIDR block + 2) to connected clients. This is done in the Client VPN endpoint settings under "DNS Servers."

* **Private Hosted Zones:** Use Route 53 Private Hosted Zones to create internal DNS names for your resources. Associate the hosted zone with the VPC where your resources reside.

* **VPC Peering vs. Client VPN:** We clarified that you are using a Client VPN, not a client VPC. VPC Peering is a different way to connect VPCs. Client VPN allows individual users to connect securely.

* **Internet Access:** You can configure your Client VPN to allow internet access from connected laptops. There are two primary methods:

    * **Full Tunnel:** All traffic (including internet) is routed through the VPN to your VPC. Requires a route in your Client VPN endpoint's route table for `0.0.0.0/0` and a route to an Internet Gateway or NAT Gateway in your VPC.
    * **Split Tunnel:** Only traffic destined for your VPC is routed through the VPN; internet traffic goes directly from the laptop. Requires *no* `0.0.0.0/0` route in the Client VPN endpoint's route table and enabling split-tunneling in the endpoint settings.

* **Configuration Steps:** We discussed the detailed steps for configuring the Client VPN endpoint, including setting DNS servers, creating routes, and adjusting authorization rules. Remember to download a new client configuration file after making changes.

* **Security Groups:** Ensure your EC2 instance's security groups allow inbound traffic from the Client VPN's client CIDR range.
