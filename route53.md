Amazon Route 53 is a highly available and scalable cloud Domain Name System (DNS) web service. It serves as the "phonebook of the internet," translating human-readable domain names (like `example.com`) into numerical IP addresses (like `192.0.2.1`) that computers use to connect to each other.

Here's a cheat sheet for Route 53, covering its core functionalities:

## Route 53 Cheat Sheet

### Core Concepts

* **Domain Name Registration:** Register and manage domain names directly within Route 53.
* **Hosted Zones:** A container for DNS records for a specific domain.
    * **Public Hosted Zone:** Manages DNS for public domains accessible on the internet.
    * **Private Hosted Zone:** Manages DNS for internal domains within your AWS VPCs, not accessible from the internet.
* **Records (Resource Record Sets):** Define how you want to route traffic for a domain name or subdomain. Each record has a name, type, value, and routing policy.
* **Health Checks:** Monitor the health of your resources (e.g., EC2 instances, ELBs) and can be integrated with routing policies for failover.
* **Routing Policies:** Determine how Route 53 responds to DNS queries.

### Key Components & Features

#### 1. Hosted Zones

* **Public Hosted Zone:**
    * Created automatically when you register a domain with Route 53.
    * Contains public DNS records (A, AAAA, CNAME, etc.).
    * Assigned 4 unique name servers (NS records) for redundancy.
* **Private Hosted Zone:**
    * Associated with one or more VPCs.
    * DNS resolution is confined to the associated VPCs.
    * Used for internal applications and services.

| **A** | **Address Record:** Maps a domain name to an IPv4 address.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| **AAAA** | **IPv6 Address Record:** Maps a domain name to an IPv6 address.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| **CNAME** | **Canonical Name Record:** Creates an alias for one domain name to another domain name. **Cannot be used at the zone apex (e.g., `example.com`).** |
| **Alias** | **Route 53 Specific Extension:** Routes traffic to selected AWS resources (ELB, CloudFront, S3 static websites, other records in the same hosted zone, etc.). **Can be used at the zone apex.** No charge for alias queries to AWS resources. Automatically recognizes changes in the target resource's IP address. You cannot set the TTL for an alias record; Route 53 uses the default TTL of the target resource.                                                                                                                                                                                                |

#### 3. Routing Policies

* **Simple Routing:**
    * Default routing policy.
    * Use for a single resource that performs a given function for your domain (e.g., a single web server).
    * If multiple values are specified in the same record, Route 53 returns all values to the client in random order (basic client-side load balancing).
    * Does NOT support health checks.
* **Failover Routing:**
    * Configures active-passive failover.
    * Routes traffic to a primary resource if it's healthy; otherwise, routes to a secondary resource.
    * Requires health checks to determine resource health.
* **Geolocation Routing:**
    * Routes traffic based on the geographic location of the user (continent, country, or even US state).
    * Useful for localizing content or restricting access based on location.
    * You can configure a "default" record for locations not explicitly covered.
* **Geoproximity Routing:**
    * Routes traffic based on the geographic location of your resources and users.
    * Allows you to define "bias" to expand or shrink the geographic region from which traffic is routed to a resource.
    * Requires AWS Traffic Flow.
* **Latency-Based Routing:**
    * Routes traffic to the AWS region that provides the lowest network latency for the user.
    * Requires resources in multiple AWS regions.
    * Based on measured latency, not geographical distance.
* **Weighted Routing:**
    * Distributes traffic to multiple resources in proportions that you specify (weights).
    * Useful for A/B testing, blue/green deployments, or gradually shifting traffic.
    * Weights can be 0 to 255. A weight of 0 means no traffic is sent.
* **Multivalue Answer Routing:**
    * Returns up to 8 healthy records in response to a DNS query.
    * Provides a simple, DNS-based load balancing mechanism without an ELB.
    * Supports health checks.
* **IP-Based Routing (CIDR-based routing):**
    * Routes traffic based on the client's IP address range (CIDR block).
    * Useful for internal corporate traffic, filtering malicious traffic, or routing to specific endpoints for certain networks.

#### 4. Health Checks

* Monitor the health of endpoints (EC2 instances, ELBs, web servers).
* Can be configured for:
    * **Endpoint:** IP address or domain name.
    * **Protocol:** HTTP, HTTPS, TCP.
    * **String Match:** (for HTTP/HTTPS) Check for a specific string in the response body.
    * **Latency:** Measure the time it takes for an endpoint to respond.
* Integrate with Failover, Weighted, and Multivalue Answer routing policies.
* Can send notifications via Amazon SNS when an endpoint becomes unhealthy.

#### 5. Route 53 Resolver

* A DNS resolver for your VPCs and on-premises networks.
* Allows your on-premises DNS servers to resolve private hosted zones in Route 53, and for your AWS resources to resolve on-premises DNS records.
* **Inbound Endpoints:** For DNS queries originating from your on-premises network to resolve DNS records in your VPCs.
* **Outbound Endpoints:** For DNS queries originating from your VPCs to resolve DNS records in your on-premises network.
* **Resolver Rules:** Define how DNS queries are handled (e.g., forward queries for a specific domain to an on-premises DNS server).

### How Route 53 Works (Simplified Flow)

1.  **User enters domain name:** A user types `www.example.com` into their browser.
2.  **DNS Resolver Query:** The user's operating system or local DNS resolver (often provided by their ISP) sends a DNS query for `www.example.com`.
3.  **Root Name Server:** If the resolver doesn't have the answer cached, it queries a DNS root name server.
4.  **TLD Name Server:** The root server directs the resolver to the `.com` Top-Level Domain (TLD) name server.
5.  **Authoritative Name Server (Route 53):** The TLD server directs the resolver to one of the four Route 53 name servers for `example.com`.
6.  **Route 53 Response:** The Route 53 name server looks up the `www.example.com` record in its hosted zone, applies the configured routing policy, and returns the appropriate IP address (or other record value) to the DNS resolver.
7.  **Browser Connects:** The DNS resolver returns the IP address to the user's browser, which then connects directly to that IP address to access the website or application.

### Key Considerations & Best Practices

* **Zone Apex (Naked Domain):** Always use **Alias records** for the zone apex (`example.com`) when pointing to AWS resources (ELBs, S3, CloudFront) because CNAMEs are not allowed at the zone apex.
* **TTL (Time To Live):** Controls how long DNS resolvers cache your records. Lower TTLs mean faster propagation of changes but more DNS queries (and potentially higher costs). Alias records inherit the TTL of the target AWS resource.
* **DNS Failover:** Implement health checks and failover routing policies for high availability.
* **Private vs. Public:** Understand when to use public vs. private hosted zones for internal and external DNS resolution.
* **Traffic Flow:** Utilize Traffic Flow to visually build and manage complex routing policies.
* **Costs:** You pay for hosted zones, DNS queries, and health checks. Alias queries to AWS resources are free.
